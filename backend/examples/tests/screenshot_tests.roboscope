  - name: Screenshot Directory Management
    description: Tests related to creating and verifying directories used for storing screenshots
    test_cases:
      - name: Create and Verify Screenshot Directory
        description: Creates a screenshots directory relative to the test file location and verifies it exists on the file system
        steps:
          - Create the screenshots directory at the path one level above the current test directory
          - Verify that the screenshots directory exists on the file system
        expected_result: The screenshots directory is successfully created and confirmed to exist
  - name: Screenshot File System Operations
    description: Tests that validate file system interactions involved in capturing and storing screenshots
    test_cases:
      - name: File System Screenshot Test
        description: Creates a test file simulating a screenshot artifact, takes a screenshot, verifies the file exists with correct content, then cleans up
        priority: high
        steps:
          - Define the target screenshot file path within the screenshots directory
          - Create a file at the defined path with the content 'Test screenshot data'
          - Take a screenshot using the Screenshot library
          - Verify that the created file exists at the expected path
          - Read the content of the file
          - Assert that the file content contains 'Test screenshot data'
          - Remove the test file to clean up after the test
        expected_result: The screenshot file is created with correct content, a screenshot is captured, and the file is successfully removed after verification
  - name: Screenshot Metadata Handling
    description: Tests that validate the generation and format of screenshot metadata such as timestamped filenames
    test_cases:
      - name: Screenshot Metadata Test
        description: Generates a Unix timestamp, constructs a screenshot name using the timestamp, and validates the name is non-empty and follows the expected naming convention
        priority: low
        steps:
          - Evaluate the current Unix timestamp as an integer using Python's time module
          - Construct a screenshot name by prefixing the timestamp with 'screenshot_'
          - Assert that the constructed screenshot name is not empty
          - Assert that the screenshot name contains the prefix 'screenshot_'
        expected_result: The screenshot name is successfully generated, is non-empty, and contains the expected 'screenshot_' prefix
